I'm going to try to keep a version of the latest cam_development branch
and the latest CLUBB external here.

To update cam_development, I think I should just be able to pull from ESCOMP/CAM,
although I should put the exact command here:

XXX

To update the CLUBB external, it might be possible to write some kind of script 
that will automatically checkout the latest source code from clubb_release, or
I can just check out clubb_release and copy the files over.  Or I could keep a 
copy of clubb_release in my home directory and link the source files over to 
CAM-CLUBB and prevent the Externals file from updating CLUBB?  There might be 
several ways to do it.
